#### Dropbox

https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<APP_KEY>&token_access_type=offline&response_type=code
```

- pass access code to following curl command to get refresh token to save with config:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dropboxapi.com/oauth2/token' \
-u '<APP_KEY>:<APP_SECRET>'
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'code=<ACCESS_CODE>' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code'
```

- update config with app_key as client_id, app_secret as client_secret, new refresh token as refresh_token

#### open ai

- Sign up for an account at `https://openai.com/api/`

- Go to your Account settings, API Keys and create a new secret key
  - You will need to refer to this as openai_api_key for commands to use open ai
